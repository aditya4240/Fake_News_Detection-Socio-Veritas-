# Fake_News_Detection-Socio-Veritas-
The growing demand for accurate and efficient data classification has led to the widespread use of
various machine learning algorithms. Existing systems primarily rely on traditional models such as Na√Øve
Bayes, Decision Trees, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Neural Networks, Random Forest, and XGBoost
for prediction and classification tasks. While these models deliver satisfactory results for static datasets,
they face limitations when handling sequential or time-dependent data. This is especially true in tasks
like fake news detection, where understanding context over time is crucial.
The proposed system addresses these limitations by employing Long Short-Term Memory (LSTMs), which
are specifically designed to capture sequential dependencies and long-term contextual information.
Unlike traditional models, LSTM can retain memory of previous inputs, making them better suited for
tasks involving text classification, sentiment analysis, and time-series prediction. By leveraging the
memory capability of LSTM, the proposed system aims to significantly improve classification accuracy,
adaptability, and scalability, thus offering a more effective solution for fake news detection in complex
and dynamic datasets.
